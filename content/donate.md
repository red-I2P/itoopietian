_The Itoopietian_ is currently seeking VPS hosting options for high bandwidth/ reliability.

This will also make it possible for multiple trusted parties to jointly manage the site and have admin server access in case one of us gets hit by a bus and can no longer update the site.

Unfortunately hosting isn't free so we have added this page in order to appeal to the I2P community to help cover hosting costs.

All funds not spent on hosting will be donated to the I2P Project.

BTC: something

XMR: something
